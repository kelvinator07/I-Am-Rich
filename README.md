I AM RICH APP

Created in Android Studio 3.2.1.

Years ago when the iPhone app store was first created. A man by the name of Armin Heinrich created a simple app called 'I Am Rich' and put the highest cost available on the iTunes store $999.00

The app lasted for a day and had 8 sales, of which 3 were refunded. The app itself didnt do anything. It just opened up to an image of a diamond with the words 'I Am Rich' there. He had the following text in his details page:

Art & Lifestyle = Not for everyone

The red icon over your iPhone or iPod touch always reminds you (and others when you show it to them) that you were able to afford this. Its a work of art with no hidden function at all. After pressing the (i) on the main page, a secret mantra will be shown. This may help you to stay rich, healthy and successful.

This is my version of the I Am Rich app and the source code which took to build it for your android device. The images used: The background image with the shooting starts was found on a simple google image search for 'shooting stars' and the diamond images were found on london app brewery.
